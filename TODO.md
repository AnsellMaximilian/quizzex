## Plans

- Make home page responsive
- Make components more modular, particularly quiz battle arenas
- Make generic reusable lists in database to be used in multiple games. (eg. words, sentences, etc.)
- User-generated content: Users will be able to create their own lists and trivia questions. A rating system will be implemented to prevent bad actors from creating bad/malicious content.
- Invite codes: invite specific players to a game by giving them battle codes
- More game types: family-feud style games, codenames, etc
- Follow/friends system
